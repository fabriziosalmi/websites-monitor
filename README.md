## How to Use

### Initial Setup

1.  **Fork This Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Configure Websites:**
    *   Edit the `config.yaml` file.
    *   Add the websites you want to monitor, one per line, under the `websites:` section.
        ```yaml
        websites:
          - audiolibri.org
          - example.com
        ```
3.  **Enable GitHub Actions (If Not Already Enabled):**
    *   Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
    *   If GitHub Actions are not enabled, enable them for your forked repository, and make sure you give write permissions.
4.  **Set the PageSpeed API Key Secret:**
    *   Obtain a Google PageSpeed Insights API key if you want to use the PageSpeed test.
    *   Navigate to "Settings" -> "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions" in your GitHub repository.
    *   Add a new repository secret named `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` and paste your API key as the value.
5.  **Create the `report_template.md` File:**
    *   Create a new file called `report_template.md` in the root of your repository if it doesn't exist.
    *   Add a default template to generate the report, for example:
    ```markdown
    # Websites Monitor
    ```
6.  **Commit All Changes:**
    *   Commit and push the changes to your forked repository to trigger the initial report generation.

### How the Monitoring Works

-   **Daily Execution:** The `create-report.yml` GitHub Action workflow is scheduled to run daily.
-   **Website Checks:** The workflow executes the `main.py` script, which performs all the checks on the websites specified in `config.yaml`.
-   **Report Generation:** The `main.py` script automatically generates the report in the `README.md` file using the `report_template.md` as a base.
-   **Automatic Updates:** The `README.md` file will be automatically updated with the latest check results after each successful run of the workflow.

## Configuration Options

The `config.yaml` file allows for various configurations:

-   `websites`: List of URLs to monitor.
-   `output_file`: The output filename of the generated report, defaults to `README.md`.
-   `max_workers`: Number of concurrent tasks when performing the checks.
-   `timeout`: Default timeout in seconds for the checks.
-   `report_template`: The filename of the report template, defaults to `report_template.md`
-   `github_workflow_badge`: The GitHub workflow badge url
-    `pagespeed_api_key`: The Google PageSpeed Insights API key (set as a GitHub Secret).

## Customizing Checks

You can modify existing checks or add new ones by editing the files in the `checks` directory and then adding the check to the `WebsiteMonitor` class in `main.py`. Ensure your new check functions follow the same format, returning an emoji indicating status (ğŸŸ¢, ğŸ”´, or âšª).

## Understanding the Output

The generated report in `README.md` includes a table with a row for each website, and the results for each check in each column.

-  ğŸŸ¢: The check is successful.
-  ğŸ”´: The check failed.
-  ğŸŸ¡: The check returned a warning or requires attention.
-  âšª: An error occurred during the check, or the check was not completed.
